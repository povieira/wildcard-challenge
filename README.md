# Wildcard Challenge

My solutions to the [Wildcard Programming Challenge](http://www.trywildcard.com/challenge).

## [Problem #1](http://www.trywildcard.com/challenge/problem1)

At Wildcard we have different card designs for different types of common user actions on the internet — product search cards, purchase cards, login cards, etc — and we use a bulletin board and index cards to brainstorm designs for different card types. The index cards are arranged on the bulletin board like so, where **[x]** represents a grid position where a card has been placed, and **[&middot;]** represents a position which is currently empty.

Since cards are representative of actions at existing web sites - like Nike.com, Walmart.com, Homedepot.com, etc - we often have many cards representing different actions for the same brand. For example Walmart may have a product search card and a store locator card. In order to keep the bulletin board grid orderly, one constraint that we'd like to apply, is that if there are multiple cards from the same brand, we'd like to lay them all out in the same row or same column so that they're easier to find as a group.

In this case, many of the spots in the grid have already been filled. One of Wildcard's designers is working on cards for a new brand, and comes up with 5 great unique cards that he has to figure out how to include in the grid. Given the current state of the grid provided by this [input file](http://www.trywildcard.com/problem1input.txt), where `*` marks an open spot and `X` marks a committed spot, *how many distinct ways can you position the 5 unique cards in open spots in the grid such that they all appear in the same row, or same column*?


## [Problem #2](http://www.trywildcard.com/challenge/problem2)

When a user searches for something on Wildcard, they are given a set of cards that will hopefully satisfy their query. There's a candidate set of cards for the query "running shoes" and Wildcard would like to send as many cards from the candidate set as possible to the user in the final set, however each card takes a certain amount of time to generate. In addition, depending on how many cards we send, each card takes a certain amount of time to position itself amongst the other cards.

For a set of N candidate cards, you are given an array generation_time of length N, where generation_time[i] is the # of milliseconds it takes to generate card i. You are also given an array overhead of length N, where overhead[i] is the number of milliseconds that it takes to position card i, for every additional card included in the final set. For example


*Example 1*

```
generation_time[0] = 2
overhead[0] = 4
final set includes 2 cards

It would take 6ms total to generate and position card 0. 
2ms to generate, and 4ms total overhead for the 1 
additional card in the final set.
```

*Example 2*

```
generation_time[0] = 20
overhead[0] = 1
final set includes 5 cards

It would take 24ms total to generate and position card 0. 
20ms to generate, and 4ms total overhead for the 4 
additional cards in the final set.
```

Unfortunately, since our servers are at capacity, we can only generate and position cards one at a time, and can't begin executing on a card in the final set until the previous card in the final set has finished executing. Your job is, given a candidate set's generate and overhead times, and a budget of the maximum # of milliseconds that we can spend constructing the final set before returning to the user, return *the maximum # of cards that we can include in the final set and send to the user in the budgeted time*.
